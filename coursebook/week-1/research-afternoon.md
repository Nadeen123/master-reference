## **Regular Expressions**

1. What is regex and what is it used for?
2. How do you use [regex101](https://regex101.com/)?
3. Using [regex101](https://regex101.com/) write regex that validates an email address. 

It would accept:
```
- 'myname_123@gmail.com'
- 'myname@gmail.co.uk'
```

It wouldnt accept:
```
- '@gmail.com'
- 'myname@'
- 'myname@gmail.com.com'
- ';myname@gmail.com'
```

4. Use the regex you have written to write a function that takes a string and returns true or false depending on whether or not the string is a vaid email address.
