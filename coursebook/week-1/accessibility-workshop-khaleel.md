# Putting yourself in someone else's shoes

The internet is a lifeline for many disabled people it gives people with various disabilities a much higher level of independence. 

This only works as long as the sites that they want to access are designed to permit disability access.

When building websites, we must be careful not to assume that everyone using it is abled bodied. your users may not be able to use a mouse, or may be visually impared.
